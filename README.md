# Library_Management
So this is a Python Program which create a simple GUI based environment for generating a Library Management portal.

# Libraries used in this program are :- 
1. sqlite3 (Which helps in storing the data of various books into a database in a row and column format based table for easy visualization and execution.)
2. tkinter (Which helps in creating a GUI based environment for making it more attractive.)

I know that i can use less libraries or some other libraries and modules that would make my task more and more easy and reduce time and space complexity.
Henceforth, I've made this code open source and would like to know your suggestions into the code via Pull Requests.
Feel free to tinker with it.
Hope you'll like it..!!
